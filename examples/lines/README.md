# Example: insert lines into a file

This example shows how to use the module `stream-insert` to insert multiple lines into a file.

It inserts two lines ('Line X' and 'Line Y') after the two searched lines ('Line A' and 'Line B') are found sequentially.

See [the source](lines.js) for more information on the module usage.
