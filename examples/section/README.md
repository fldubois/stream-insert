# Example: insert lines between two boundaries

This example shows how to use the module `stream-insert` to insert lines between two specific lines.

It inserts lines 'Line 4' and 'Line 5' after the line 'Line 3' between the line 'Heading 2' and 'Heading 3'.

See [the source](section.js) for more information on the module usage.
